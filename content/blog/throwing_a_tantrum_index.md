Welcome to the Throwing a Tantrum tutorial!
In this n+1-part series, we will be exploring how you can extend angr with new features without editing angr itself.
We'll be covering a range of topics from `gymrat` to Analyses, and including a plethora of examples and explanations along the way.
If you're interested in learning how to port angr to a new architecture, write a custom engine or analysis, or even (*gasp*)
use angr to analyze BrainFuck programs, then read on.
